Hi! I’m **Qihan Wu**, a cognitive scientist with a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University.

My research focuses on how we perceive and represent object orientation in motion, particularly rotational motion. I use behavioral experiments, psychophysics, and computational modeling to understand visual tracking and perceptual organization.

I’m especially interested in:
- How representational formats align (or conflict) with task procedures
- Perception of motion in complex spatial paths
- Applying vision science to UX research

When I’m not working, I enjoy coding visual demos and mentoring students interested in cognitive science.
